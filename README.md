# PyTorch Learning Journey 🔥

Just me learning PyTorch from scratch. Nothing fancy, just notebooks and experiments.

## What's Inside

**Zero to One/** - Main learning path with fundamentals, workflows, and classification stuff. Started with basics and working my way up.

**Documentation/** - Official PyTorch tutorials and examples. FashionMNIST models and whatnot.

**PyTorch Advanced Architectures and Deployment/** - Future stuff. Mostly empty for now but that's where I'm headed.

## Structure

- Jupyter notebooks for everything
- Helper functions scattered around (`helper_functions.py`, `helper_utils.py`)
- Saved models in `.pth` files
- Some unit tests because why not

## Topics Covered

- PyTorch fundamentals (tensors, operations, etc.)
- Basic workflow (data → model → training → inference)
- Neural network classification
- Model saving/loading

## Running This

Standard PyTorch setup:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision
jupyter notebook
```

Then just open whatever notebook you want.

## Notes

- Lots of checkpoint files and `__pycache__` around, ignore those
- Some notebooks are exercises, some are complete solutions
- Models are saved locally, nothing cloud-based yet
